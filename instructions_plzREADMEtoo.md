Some of these sections include optional information we may want/need to include. So please, do check the README document.
I would also suggest that we all review the others' sections when they are ready.
If you know what part you would like to write, just type your name next to it. I assigned myself to sampling plan, but if anyone has a strong preference for that section, I do not mind switching to design plan.
