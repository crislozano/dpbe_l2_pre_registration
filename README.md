## Study Information

### The double phonemic boundary effect in Bilinguals: a replication study in L2 Spanish learners


**Provide the working title of your study. It may be the same title that you submit for publication of your final manuscript, but it is not a requirement.**


### Description (optional)

**Please give a brief description of your study, including some background, the purpose of the study, or broad research questions.**

Several authors have demonstrated the double phonemic boundary effect in bilingual population , providing a strong evidence to support the hypothesis of a language-specific phonemic system in bilingual mind. Therefore, the aim of this study is to extend prior findigs to a new population of Heritage L2 Spanish learners and English native L2 Spanish learners.





### Hypotheses 

### Hipothesis 1
Bilinguals shift perception across language context by switching between language-specific phonetic systems. Non-directional hypothesis. There is a relationship between the existence of two separate phonetic systems and the speaker shift perception of the sounds.

### Hipothesis 2
Bilinguals identification of the VOT stimuli varies depending on the language context. Non-directional hypothesis. There is a relationship between the language context and the  identification of the VOT stimuli by  bilinguals.

### Hipothesis 3
Proficiency have an effect in the voicing identification boundaries between English and Spanish. Directional hypothesis. There is a positive relation between proficiency and the identificacion of voicing boundarie.



## Design Plan

### Study type (required)

**Please check one of the following statements**

- Experiment - A researcher randomly assigns treatments to study subjects, this includes field or lab experiments. This is also known as an intervention experiment and includes randomized controlled trials.


Study type

- Experiment. Researchers randomly assigns subjects for the experiment. There will be one experiment with two sessions. Trials will be randomized by Psychopy.


### Blinding (required)

**Blinding describes who is aware of the experimental manipulations within a study. Mark all that apply.**

- No blinding is involved in this study.
- For studies that involve human subjects, they will not know the treatment group to which they have been assigned.
- Personnel who interact directly with the study subjects (either human or non-human subjects) will not be aware of the assigned treatments. (Commonly known as “double blind”)
- Personnel who analyze the data collected from the study are not aware of the treatment applied to any given group.

- In this research personnel will be aware of the assigned experiments. Participants will not know to which group they have been assigned.




### Is there any additional blinding in this study? (optional)

**Add information here**



### Study design (required)

**Describe your study design. Examples include two-group, factorial, randomized block, and repeated measures. Is it a between (unpaired), within-subject (paired), or mixed design? Describe any counterbalancing required. Typical study designs for observation studies include cohort, cross sectional, and case-control studies.**



### Randomization (optional)

**If you are doing a randomized study, how will you randomize, and at what level?**







## Sampling Plan

### Existing Data (required)

- Registration prior to creation of data 

Pre-registration is occurring before data collection for the intended research. No previous existing data will be analyzed. This research will be confirmatory. The studies taken as reference are discussed right below.

Gonzales and Lotto (2013) cued their early Spanish-English bilinguals perceptually and conceptually in a forced-choice task in which participants had to select whether the pseudo-word containing a sound from the /b/ or /p/ continuum they were hearing was Spanish or English. Gonzales et al. (2019) cued their Spanish-English and French-English bilingual participants only conceptually. In both studies, findings suggest that participants adjusted their phonemic identification boundary according to the language context. Casillas and Simonet (2018) expanded the population by adding beginner and proficient L2 speakers. These participants were cued perceptually. They found that late bilingual speakers also show evidence of the double phonemic boundary effect, although this effect was more pronounced in more advanced late bilingual speakers.



### Sample size (required)

**Describe the sample size of your study. How many units will be analyzed in the study? This could be the number of people, birds, classrooms, plots, interactions, or countries included. If the units are not individuals, then describe the size requirements for each unit. If you are using a clustered or multilevel design, how many units are you collecting at each level of the analysis?**

    This study aims at replicating the results found in those three investigations, and to collect data for a condition not tested yet – when speakers are only conceptually cued. In order to do so, new data will be collected following the same procedure as in those studies from an adult L2 population on the east coast of the U.S. The population will be mostly college-aged, and they will participate as part of the grade for their Spanish courses (both language and content), or voluntarily. The goal is to get around 30 participants for each group: beginner and intermediate learners of L2 Spanish, and early English-Spanish bilinguals. Their proficiency will be assessed through the Bilingual Language Profile (BLP) questionnaire (Birdsong, Gertken, & Amengual, 2012). Special attention will be paid to the language history (range [120, 120]) and the proficiency (range [24, 24]) modules. For the early bilinguals, a score closer to 0 indicates balanced bilingualism and such values are what we are looking for for this group of participants.

### Data collection procedures (required)


    Data collection should last about two weeks, and participants will complete the experiment in a single session individually at a computer with a headset. There may be other participants completing the experiment at the same time, but no interaction will take place between them. Due to monetary restrictions and scarcity of population constraints, data collection might take longer than the two expected weeks or the pool of participants may be reduced.
    The procedure consists of a forced-choice task. Participants will be presented aurally syllables (pa – ba) from the voiced-voiceless continuum /b/-/p/, spanning from the Spanish /b/ to the English /p/ one by one. There will be two blocks, and participants will be cued conceptually that they are going to hear English or Spanish. The blocks order will be counterbalanced across participants. For both blocks the syllables will be taken from the whole continuum. After hearing the syllable, participants will have to choose whether they heard /pa/ or /ba/. There will be no extra sounds in the stimuli biasing the responses towards one language or the other.



## Variables

### Manipulated variables (optional)

**Describe all variables you plan to manipulate and the levels or treatment arms of each variable. This is not applicable to any observational study.**





### Measured variables (required)

**Describe each variable that you will measure. This will include outcome measures, as well as any predictors or covariates that you will measure. You do not need to include any variables that you plan on collecting if they are not going to be included in the confirmatory analyses of this study.**




### Indices (optional)

**If any measurements are going to be combined into an index (or even a mean), what measures will you use and how will they be combined? Include either a formula or a precise description of your method. If you are using a more complicated statistical method to combine measures (e.g. a factor analysis), you can note that here but describe the exact method in the analysis plan section.**







## Analysis Plan

### Statistical models (required)

**What statistical model will you use to test each hypothesis? Please include the type of model (e.g. ANOVA, multiple regression, SEM, etc) and the specification of the model (this includes each variable that will be included as predictors, outcomes, or covariates). Please specify any interactions, subgroup analyses, pairwise or complex contrasts, or follow-up tests from omnibus tests. If you plan on using any positive controls, negative controls, or manipulation checks you may mention that here. Remember that any test not included here must be noted as an exploratory test in your final article.**




### Transformations (optional)

**If you plan on transforming, centering, recoding the data, or will require a coding scheme for categorical variables, please describe that process.**




### Inference criteria (optional)

**What criteria will you use to make inferences? Please describe the information you’ll use (e.g. specify the p-values, Bayes factors, specific model fit indices), as well as cut-off criterion, where appropriate. Will you be using one or two tailed tests for each of your analyses? If you are comparing multiple conditions or testing multiple hypotheses, will you account for this?**




### Data exclusion (optional)

**How will you determine which data points or samples if any to exclude from your analyses? How will outliers be handled? Will you use any awareness check?**




### Missing data (optional)

**How will you deal with incomplete or missing data?**




### Exploratory analysis (optional)

**If you plan to explore your data set to look for unexpected differences or relationships, you may describe those tests here. An exploratory test is any test where a prediction is not made up front, or there are multiple possible tests that you are going to use. A statistically significant finding in an exploratory test is a great way to form a new confirmatory hypothesis, which could be registered at a later time.**
